Get info and track ip

![nodeIptracer](https://i.imgur.com/vXzFl5T.png)

It is a small program that retrieves several pieces of information from an ip (v4 or v6).
Here is the information:

 - Country
 - City
 - Region
 - Long / Lat
 - timezone

And the possibility of performing a traceroute.

With Longitude / Latitude value, I display a pointer on a map.
Regarding the map, normally, you need a valid google map api key, if you don't have one, don't worry, when opening the software, just put a space in the api key field (see image if below), the card will work but with a watermark.
